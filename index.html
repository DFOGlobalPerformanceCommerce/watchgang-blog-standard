                    <h1>This is the Startup That Watch Lovers Have Been Waiting For</h1>
                    <p>Watch lovers are in for a special treat. <a href="http://track.agencyytrk.com/click">Watch Gang</a> , in just it’s second year, has become the largest and most loved watch of the month club in the world. Watch Gang now has more than 20,000 active subscribers. Since Grammy/Academy Award Winner Jamie Foxx posted about them on Instagram, growth has absolutely exploded. Even Entourage star, Jeremy Piven has joined Watch Gang.</p>

                <div class="blog-copy">
                    <h3>How It Works</h3>
                    <p>You pay a monthly membership fee based on what tier of watch you choose and each month they send you a watch in the mail. Each month’s watch is a surprise, you don’t know what to expect. You select watch preferences when you sign up, that you can adjust at any time, and the watch you get each month is based off of them. They match the watches to your preferences as closely as possible, while still providing a good variety to ensure a full spectrum of watches for your collection.</p>

                    <p><a href="http://track.agencyytrk.com/click">Watch Gang</a> has 3 tiers of watches for members to choose from, Original, Black, and Platinum Tiers. There is also a non-recurring extremely limited membership called Centum ($1,000), which is where they partner with a brand and offer a limited edition watch from their collection exclusively to Watch Gang members. These watches typically range in value from $1,500-$5,000.</p>

                    <h3>Membership Bonuses</h3>
                    <p>Arguably just as cool as the subscription is the bonuses that all <a href="http://track.agencyytrk.com/click">Watch Gang</a> Members receive. Every Friday, one lucky member wins a Rolex and every Tuesday, a TAG. Members from any tier are eligible to win the Rolex and the TAG watches. They host the giveaways live on all their social media channels, and also giveaway lots of other things like a free month’s sub, or points for The Wheel. The Wheel is another way Watch Gang rewards its members. Points are earned with each month’s membership, can be won, and also purchased. Depending on how many points you have and want to use, you can select the appropriate tier of wheel to play. You get to choose what watches go on the wheel, and you get to select higher tier watches to add to the wheel, so you have a chance to win a better watch. This is cool because you can get a watch you want and have a chance at winning something better. Also, Watch Gang often has flash sales where members can get great deals on watches until the supply is sold out.</p>

                    <p><a href="http://track.agencyytrk.com/click">Watch Gang</a> Exchange is their Facebook Group where members can Buy, Sell, or Trade anything relating to watches, whether it be bands, extra links, winders, or watches. This is one of the most active groups out there. If you aren’t happy with a watch you got during a given month, it is very easy to find someone who will gladly take it off your hands.</p>
                    <p>Customer Service is awesome. They take the saying “It’s the little things that count” to heart. They are very friendly and quick to respond.</p>

                            <p>This will be my third month with the gang, since I've been a member they have grown. Adding platinum for 299.99 and now centum at 1k. It's like Christmas comes once a month. If and when you don't like what was sent there's always someone out there who does. A great community to be a part of and too notch customer service!!!</p>

                            <p>It's a love hate relationship with Watch Gang... I hate that I love it so much! My watch collection has gone from 5-6 to over 20 in a matter of 7 months with the Gang! I've given a few as great gifts and the recipients jaws dropped. I know I'm not the only one out there that loves coming home to presents!</p>

                            <p>Definitely an awesome company! I've been happy with most of the watches from the regular sub, and the other ones I just give to my friends. However, it took me a while to realize the last watch I got was worth 200$, and I paid 25$ for it! Easily worth the money.</p>
